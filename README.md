# EarthSculpt
Earthsculpt is a open source game terrain creation program in its first stages. EarthSculpt is different as it seeks to provide heavy extendibility and community involvment, and create features the community needs. We listen to your thoughts in order to create the most appealing software. This program is mainly a 2d heightmap generation program, so overhangs, caves etc. will not be supported, unless someone is willing to implement these things.

# Help Wanted
Since EarthSculpt is very early in development, some people are needed to progress the program since there are some things I am extremely weak at. Right now, I would like some help focusing on the device display, and devices such as a erosion device, perlin device, and the voronoi device.
